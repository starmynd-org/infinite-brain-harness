# Infinite Brain Harness

A multi-brain workspace: the harness you open in Claude Code (or Codex) to work across more than one
Infinite Brain at once. It mounts your brains under `internal/`, routes your work to the right one, keeps
them synced over git (GitHub by default), and keeps one registry of every repo you run.

The engine is the Infinite Brain, the public brain starter at
https://github.com/starmynd-org/infinite-brain-os. The harness is the mount: it holds your brains side by
side and keeps agents oriented and synced across them.

## Why a tier above the brain

A brain repo is self-contained: it carries its own orientation, knowledge, and startup discipline. But
real work quickly spans more than one brain: a shared company or department brain everyone relies on, and
your own individual brain for scratch and research. Three problems appear the moment the second brain
exists:

1. An agent needs one place to orient from, or every session starts by guessing which brain is which.
2. A brain must not absorb its siblings. A brain that tracks other repos' state stops being a brain.
3. The brains need to sync. Your work must back up and the shared brain's releases must come down,
   without you running git by hand.

The harness solves all three. You open it, not a brain in isolation. It routes between the brains under
`internal/`, and its `/start` and `/sync` commands do the git so you never have to.

## One folder for everything you own: `internal/`

`internal/` holds every repo your own operation owns, and the harness treats two kinds of child
differently:

- the **brains it mounts**: a **shared brain** (a company brain, or a department brain that graduated to
  its own repo), the default working surface and the canon everyone relies on; and your **individual
  brain** (`individual-<name>/`), your own layer with fewer guardrails. These are cloned in, validated,
  registered, synced, and their commands are copied up so they work here;
- **every other repo you own**: product code, client apps, tools. Registered and routed to, never
  mounted.

It tells them apart structurally rather than from a list: a child is a mounted brain when it carries both
`.claude/` and `_system/validate.sh`, the marker every brain built from the starter has and no app repo
does. So an app repo can carry its own `.claude/` without its commands leaking into the root.

`external/` is the other half of the ownership axis: repos a client owns or that are co-operated with an
outside party, grouped under `external/<group>/`. Brains are never mounted from `external/`.

The routing rule: real and shared work goes to the shared brain; anything experimental or unproven starts
in your individual brain; proven work is promoted up, never edited into the shared brain directly.

### Quickstart

Prerequisites: git, an AI coding agent ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) is the primary
runtime), a GitHub account, and ideally the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) for
authentication. `/start` checks all of this and tells you what is missing.

1. Clone this repository to where you want your root, and open it in Claude Code:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/starmynd-org/infinite-brain-harness.git harness
   ```

2. In the chat, run **`/start`**. It establishes git access (GitHub by default), clones your brains into
   `internal/`, validates and registers them, and runs `/sync`. On a brand-new harness with no brains, it
   creates them for you: your company brain starts as a clone of the public starter with origin
   re-pointed at a private repo of your own (the public starter cannot be pushed to), and your
   individual brain starts as your own empty private repo.
3. Restart Claude Code when `/start` says so: the brains' own slash commands load only on restart.
4. Work. Real work in the shared brain, experiments in your own; `/sync` backs everything up and pulls
   the latest. `/workspace-help` explains the rest.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/start` | Set up or wake up the machine: git access, create or clone the brains, validate and register them, then `/sync`. |
| `/sync` | Push your individual brain; push shared-brain content; route shared-brain core changes to a `proposal/<slug>-<topic>` branch for review; pull the latest; refresh the copied command layer and the capability index. |
| `/save` | Commit every brain with your name on it, no push. |
| `/promote-to-department` | Package individual work for review before it reaches the shared brain. |
| `/workspace-help` | Explain the harness in plain words. |
| `register-repo` | Register a child repo in the registry (see the registry root, below). |

Each brain's own commands, skills, agents, and rules are copied up into this root by `/sync` so they work
as slash commands here (after a Claude Code restart). `.claude/CAPABILITIES.md`, regenerated on sync,
lists what each brain holds so you route work to the right one.

## The registry

Every child under `internal/` and `external/` is an independent git repo the harness ignores and knows
only through a `repo-registry/` entry, mounted brains included, so one inventory covers everything.

Brains come in three tiers: one **company brain** (the standard-setter and upstream core), an
**individual brain per person**, and **department brains** that graduate from folders to their own repo
only when a real trust boundary fires. **App repos** are ordinary siblings with `repo_kind: app`, no
brain ontology and no tier. To register a repo, follow `ADD-A-BRAIN.md` or run `register-repo`; the
result is one new file under `repo-registry/`. `/start` writes the entry for each brain it mounts.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` | root orientation for Claude Code and Codex; mirrors of each other |
| `.claude/commands/` | the workspace commands (`start`, `sync`, `save`, `promote-to-department`, `workspace-help`) and `register-repo` |
| `.claude/refresh-commands.sh` | the copy-up and capability-index generator, run by `/start` and `/sync` |
| `.claude/settings.json` | the harness's permission guards (no model pin: your own default model applies) |
| `internal/` | everything you own: the brains `/start` mounts, plus your other repos. All ignored |
| `external/` | client-owned or co-operated repos, grouped under `external/<group>/`. All ignored |
| `ADD-A-BRAIN.md` | the registration procedure |
| `repo-registry/` | one entry per registered child |

## What the harness never carries

- no brain content of its own: knowledge, doctrine, and entities live inside a brain
- no child repo state: every child under `internal/` and `external/`, brains included, is an independent
  git repo with its own remote; the harness ignores their contents and provides no backup
- no live runtime state or secrets: the copied command layer and the capability index are generated,
  git-ignored, and regenerated by `/sync`; they are read-only downstream and never a second source of
  truth; local agent settings stay untracked

## Local files

`.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` is available for personal, local-only notes; the shipped `.gitignore` keeps it
and the rest of local agent state (`settings.local.json`, `mcp-servers.json`) out of git.
